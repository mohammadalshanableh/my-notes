The Goals of Software Design
Every programmer is a designer.

When software is hard to create or modify, developers spend most of their time focusing on making things “just work,” and less time focusing on helping users. The design of software aims to make developers job as easy as possible so they can focus on what matters. You will create software that will help users and your software will continue to help them for a long time.

However, if you design a bad system, your software’s lifetime will be short.

This brings us to the most important goal of the software design:

To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their developers, so that they can be — and continue to be — as helpful as possible. — Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity
So there are two key points here: Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.
